title: Getting an Apress subscription
excerpt: Is an Apress Access subscription worth it?
---

<p>
Recently, I purchased an <a href="https://www.apress.com/">Apress</a> Access subscription for $199.00. It's a pretty
steep price for subscribing to a single publisher, but I bit the bullet for
several reasons:
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Apress publishes solid technical books, and seems to take more risk than
other publishers (e.g. <a href="http://www.oreilly.com/">O'Reilly</a>).
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>They published Peter Seibel's <a href="http://www.gigamonkeys.com/book/index.html">Practical Common Lisp</a>, for example, back in
2005, when Lisp books were <i>pass√©</i>.
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>You can read e-books online for free (though the reader is not great).
</li>
<li>You can buy an e-book to keep for $4.99.
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>E-books are available in PDF, which is not the case with Amazon.
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>They had a book I really wanted to read in that wasn't available on Amazon
(yet), <a href="http://weitz.de/lisp.html">Edi Weitz</a>'s <a href="http://weitz.de/cl-recipes/">Common Lisp Recipes</a>.
</li>
</ul>

<p>
All of these are decent reasons for purchasing a subscription, but what
convinced me most of all is an important lesson I've learned over the years:
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Never be afraid to invest in yourself.
</li>
</ul>

<p>
So, is an Apress subscription "worth it"? It really depends on what you do
with it.
</p>

<p>
Financially speaking, if you're going to purchase and read at least four books
per year, each costing on average $55 or so, and assuming you can't get them
cheaper elsewhere, a subscription would save you money compared to purchasing
directly.
</p>

<p>
If you're like me, however, you'll actually use the financial cost to your
advantage. Having paid for a subscription, I'd feel guilty if I didn't make
good use of it. Finding motivation is often difficult, and I find that
financial guilt is a great one to get me to read a book and learn something.

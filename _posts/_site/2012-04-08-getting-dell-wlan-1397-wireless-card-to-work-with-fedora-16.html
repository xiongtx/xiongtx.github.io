<p>So I decided to dual-boot my computer with Linux. I've been mildly aware of wireless card problems with Linux before, but I never would have thought that it would be this difficult to get things to work right. Here's the solution, courtesy of a forum post<del datetime="2012-04-08T07:31:29+00:00"> I can't find the link to now</del>. Thanks <del datetime="2012-04-08T07:31:29+00:00">to that mysterious person</del> user <tt>stoat</tt> from fedoraforums.org (<a href="http://forums.fedoraforum.org/showthread.php?t=264315">link to post</a>) who saved me from hours (more) of frustration.</p>
<p>The Dell WLAN 1397 Wireless card is shown to be the Broadcom BCM4312 802.11b/g LP-PHY (rev 01) card through the <code>lspci</code> command. The file needed is called</p>
<pre>broadcom-wl-4.150.10.5.tar.bz2</pre>
<p>It should be floating around on the internet, available through a quick search. Too bad WordPress won't allow upload of <tt>.tar.bz2</tt> files.</p>
<p>Get the file onto Fedora through a USB, then navigate to the containing folder using the terminal. Run the following commandsÂ in the terminal</p>
<pre>
tar xjf broadcom-wl-r.150.10.5.tar.bz2
cd su broadcom-wl-r.150.10.5/driver
su 
b43-fwcutter -w /lib/firmware wl_apsta_mimo.o
</pre>
<p>Finally, restart the computer. Wireless internet should be working.</p>

<p>I thought that WordPress.com blogs could not do syntax highlighting, but I was wrong! And I am so glad that I am wrong on this! Not only is there syntax highlighting for many languages available (see <a href="http://en.support.wordpress.com/code/posting-source-code/">here</a>), but the code is automatically formatted as well (<strong>edit:</strong> the syntax highlighter will remove extraneous spaces like initial indentations, but won't automatically adjust things like braces and parentheses).</p>
<p>The only downside is that keyword colors cannot be changed; the default colors aren't bad, however.</p>
<p>Below is a snippet of C++/CLI code used as a test.</p>
<p>[sourcecode language="cpp"]</p>
<p>// Open a student catalog .txt file<br />
private: void OpenStudentCatalog(void)<br />
{<br />
    OpenFileDialog^ openStudentCatalog = gcnew OpenFileDialog;<br />
    openStudentCatalog-&gt;Title = &quot;Open student catalog...&quot;;<br />
    openStudentCatalog-&gt;Filter = &quot;Text files (*.txt)|*.txt&quot;;</p>
<p>    if (openStudentCatalog-&gt;;ShowDialog() == System::Windows::Forms::DialogResult::OK){<br />
	this-&gt;pathStudentCatalog = openStudentCatalog-&gt;;FileName;<br />
    }<br />
}</p>

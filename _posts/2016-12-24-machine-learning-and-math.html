title: Machine learning and math
excerpt: A strong math background is essential for machine learning
---

<p>
Machine learning is a hot field these days&#x2013;just about every big company is investing heavily in ML research and development. It's a far cry from the immediate aftermath of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AI_winter">AI winter</a>, a period of reduced funding and interest in AI research in the 1980's that was the result of excessive business hype, the winding down of the Cold War, and interest in a new, exciting technology&#x2013;the internet.
</p>

<p>
Technology is a fashion industry, so it's no surprise that interest in AI rises and falls every decade or so. Yet, the capabilities of modern ML <i>may</i> be reaching a threshold. With good enough algorithms, sufficient computing power, and oceanic volumes of data, machines can be <i>good enough</i> to perform many tasks that are currently done by humans, from cataloging to driving automobiles.

<p>
I've been taking <a href="https://www.coursera.org/learn/machine-learning/home/welcome">Andrew Ng's machine learning course</a> on Coursera for the past few weeks, and am about halfway through. Here are a few observations:
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>A strong math background, especially in calculus and linear algebra, is absolutely necessary
</li>
<li>A strong statistics background would be very useful
</li>
<li>An engineering background is surprisingly helpful, if only because of expose to MATLAB/Octave.
</li>
</ul>

<p>
First, let me state an irrefutable fact: being good at math is essential for studying machine learning. This is a heavily quantitative/computational area of computer science, one that could easily fit within an applied math department. I'm very glad to have been a math major at Duke; it's a lot easier to feel comfortable with the math and learn the necessary programming than to know how to program but be forced to learn a lot of math.
</p>

<p>
A strong statistics background would also be useful; alas, I've taken only a few statistics courses. Good intuition about probabilities could lead to better-designed ML systems.
</p>

<p>
An engineering background is not essential, but definitely helpful. For one thing, Prof. Ng's course uses MATLAB/Octave, a linear algebra focused language that's great for prototyping. <i>Real</i> ML systems, especially the massive ones used at large companies, likely use C++ for performance, but the concepts and calculations are much easier to express in MATLAB/Octave. MATLAB/Octave was my first "programming" language, and has imprinted on me many good expectations of programming languages, such as a REPL and functional programming style.
</p>

<p>
I studied math and engineering with no expectation that I would end up writing software, but my math/engineering background turns out to give me a leg up in the hottest computer science field today. I always like to think that good decisions pay off eventually, and I'm very glad that the things I spent 4 years studying have suddenly returned to relevance.

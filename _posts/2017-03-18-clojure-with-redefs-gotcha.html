title: Clojure with-redefs gotcha
excerpt: A Clojure compiler optimization breaks a problematic macro
---

<p>
The <code>with-redefs</code> macro in Clojure is one of the most problematic. The <a href="https://clojuredocs.org/clojure.core/with-redefs">description</a> says:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
binding =&gt; var-symbol temp-value-expr
</p>

<p>
Temporarily redefines Vars while executing the body.  The
temp-value-exprs will be evaluated and each resulting value will
replace in parallel the root value of its Var.  After the body is
executed, the root values of all the Vars will be set back to their
old values.  These temporary changes will be visible in all threads.
<b>Useful for mocking out functions during testing</b>.
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
The last part about being "useful for mocking out functions during testing" (emphasis mine) has encouraged many users, myself included, to use <code>with-redefs</code> frequently. However, there are some unfortunate gotchas, one of which I encountered recently.
</p>

<p>
Take the following:
</p>

<div class="org-src-container">

<pre class="src src-clojure">(defn foo
  [^long a]
  "foo")

(with-redefs [foo (fn [x] "bar")]
  (foo "x"))
</pre>
</div>

<p>
We'd expect <code>(foo "x")</code> to return ~"bar"~, but it instead throws an exception:
</p>

<pre class="example">
ClassCastException user$eval20544$fn__20545 cannot be cast to clojure.lang.IFn$LO  user/eval20544/fn--20547 (form-init538441322648284404.clj:45)
</pre>

<p>
Getting the Var directly and applying it to ~"x"~ <i>does</i> work, however:
</p>

<div class="org-src-container">

<pre class="src src-clojure">(with-redefs [foo (fn [x] "bar")]
  ((var foo) "x"))
;; =&gt; "bar"
</pre>
</div>

<p>
What's going on? As it turns out, the Clojure compiler optimizes <a href="https://github.com/clojure/clojure/blob/clojure-1.8.0/src/jvm/clojure/lang/IFn.java#L97">functions whose parameters have primitive type hints</a>. The compiler "knows" that <code>foo</code> takes a <code>long</code> and returns an <code>Object</code> (<code>String</code>). By redefining <code>foo</code> to a function that takes an <code>Object</code> (the default without a type hint) and returns an <code>Object</code>, we fail to match types. Invoking the <i>Var</i> of <code>foo</code> gets around this.
</p>

<p>
We see that <code>foo</code> <i>can</i> be redefed with a function that has the same type:
</p>

<div class="org-src-container">

<pre class="src src-clojure">(with-redefs [foo (fn [^long x] "bar")]
  (foo 1))
;; =&gt; "bar"
</pre>
</div>

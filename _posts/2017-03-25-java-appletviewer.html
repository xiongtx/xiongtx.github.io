excerpt: Viewing Java applets when browsers stop supporting them
---

<p>
I had a tough time today trying to view Java applets in the browser.
</p>

<p>
Chrome started deprecating support for NPAPI (the API supporting plugins like Java applets) <a href="https://blog.chromium.org/2013/09/saying-goodbye-to-our-old-friend-npapi.html">all the way back in 2013</a>, and Firefox will <a href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1269807">stop supporting it (except for Flash)</a> in Firefox 52. Oracle is <a href="http://openjdk.java.net/jeps/289">deprecating</a> (though not removing) support for Java applets in Java 9.
</p>

<p>
Java applets won't run in Firefox 49, so I tried to <a href="https://support.mozilla.org/t5/Install-and-Update/Install-an-older-version-of-Firefox/ta-p/1564">install an older version of Firefox</a>. This is surprisingly difficult, by design&#x2013;Mozilla really doesn't want Average Joe to install an older version of Firefox, so they stuck all the older versions in a directory as tarballs.
</p>

<p>
First, I tried instally 64-bit Firefox 45, but apparently <a href="https://java.com/en/download/help/firefox_java.xml">64-bit Firefox hasn't supported Java applets</a> since I-don't-know-when. I then installed 32-bit Firefox 45&#x2013;no dice. 32-bit Firefox <i>41</i>? Still doesn't work.
</p>

<p>
Finally, I found that there's a much easier way to view Java applets: using the bundled <code>appletviewer</code>, which works with <a href="http://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/technotes/tools/windows/appletviewer.html">both local and remote HTML files</a>.

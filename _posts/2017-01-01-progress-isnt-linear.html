title: Progress isn't linear
excerpt: What can be done in a fresh set of 365 days?

<p>
The best advice I've ever heard regarding success is simply
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
Finish what you start
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
The simplicity is deceiving; sticking with something to the <i>end</i>, however that's defined, is very hard to do. Most people quit shortly after they start, when the initial burst of progress that accompanies a new endeavor fades and is replaced by a long, slow slog.
</p>

<p>
The biggest challenge is that <b>progress isn't linear</b>. This is a well-understood phenomenon, often referred to as the <b>valley of despair</b>.

One year ago, I began to seriously look at <a href="https://clojure.org/">Clojure</a>, and started having the aspiration of using it in my day job. At the time, I was writing <a href="http://www.intersystems.com/our-products/cache/cache-overview/">Cach√©</a> as a business intelligence developer at Epic and feeling very unhappy at my job, especially at the use of old, niche technology that wasn't teaching me anything new. For months, I wasn't sure I would be able to make the switch to software development, let alone in Clojure. I knew very little about popular technologies, from cloud computing to machine learning, and knew only the basics of web development.
</p>

<p>
It is my great fortune that, when under stress, I have a tendency to rise to the challenge. I took <a href="https://www.coursera.org/learn/meteor-development">Cousera courses on web development</a>; I <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Cracking-Coding-Interview-Programming-Questions/dp/098478280X">practiced interview questions</a> with friends; I attended <a href="http://clojurewest.org/">Clojure/west</a> and met the great Clojure community. Six months later I interviewed with and received an offer from <a href="https://www.fundingcircle.com/us/">Funding Circle</a>.
</p>

<p>
Looking back, I probably fell victim to a familiar mindset of <b>overestimating challenges</b>. When challenges appear overwhelming, it can be difficult to get started. Yet, once the initial foot-dragging is overcome, working harder than I "need" to is often an advantage: I end up learning a lot more than I would otherwise.
</p>

<p>
So how can I best make use of a fresh set of 365 days? A few words of advice to myself:
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Get started <i>now</i>, no matter how big the challenge
</li>
<li>Take both accomplishments and setbacks in context
</li>
<li>Expect long stretches of (seemingly) no progress, i.e. the valley of despair. Keep moving during such times.
</li>
<li>You don't have complete control over outcomes, but you do have control over your time. Don't waste time.
</li>
<li>Plan
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>If you value your time, planning becomes an itch to scratch
</li>
<li>Planning shorter periods (a week, a month) is easier than planning longer periods
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Finish what you start
</li>
</ul>

<p>
None of these are "resolutions", per se. Resolutions are about outcomes, and people usually fail to achieve them because they haven't changed their <i>mindset</i> and <i>processes</i> from the past year; as such, they follow the same processes and expect a different outcome.
</p>

<p>
Changing mindset and processes is much harder than desiring an outcome. It is <i>especially</i> vulnerable to long stretches of (seemingly) no progress: the time frame is a lifetime. So, what's a better time to get started than <i>now</i>?

title: Put aside the math
excerpt: Programming is not a very mathematical activity
---

<p>
In my latest attempt to understand what a monad is and why it's useful, I've come much further than previous attempts by doing one thing&#x2013;putting aside the math.
</p>

<p>
That's right&#x2013;for the first time, I resisted the urge to start reading about category theory halfway through reading about monads.
</p>

<p>
Instead, I forced myself to stare at the function signatures of Haskell's <code>Functor</code>, <code>Applicative</code> and <code>Monad</code> and think in terms of "wrapping" and "unwrapping" boxes. In other words, I actually tried to be a <i>programmer</i> for once<sup><a id="fnr.1" name="fnr.1" class="footref" href="#fn.1">1</a></sup>.
</p>

<p>
Given the progress I've made this time around, I think I'll do this more in the future.

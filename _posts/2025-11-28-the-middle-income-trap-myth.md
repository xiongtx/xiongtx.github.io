title: The middle income trap myth
excerpt: What looks like stalled development is really a distribution problem
---

Economists love to talk about the [middle income trap](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Middle_income_trap), wherein developing countries that have achieved rapid growth suddenly stall out, unable to make the leap to high-income status. The usual explanations invoke limitations of technology, productivity, or institutional capacity. These framings, however, miss the point entirely. There is no trap--only a resource distribution problem masquerading as a development ceiling.

## Two countries in one

Visit Shanghai, Seoul, or Mexico City and you'll find infrastructure, services, and living standards indistinguishable from those of New York or London. The gleaming towers, efficient metros, and world-class hospitals of these urban centers prove that "middle income" countries possess all the technological and organizational capacity needed to achieve developed-world outcomes.

The problem is that these islands of prosperity float in seas of poverty. Drive a few hours from any of these metropolises and you'll find villages that lack reliable electricity, clean water, or paved roads. The rural interior of countries "trapped" in middle income status often resembles the poorest nations on Earth, not the gleaming cities that represent them in international statistics.

When economists calculate GDP per capita, they're averaging the Shanghai banker with the Gansu farmer, the Mexico City executive with the Chiapas subsistence grower. The resulting figure--solidly "middle income"--obscures a reality of extreme bifurcation. There is no unified economy gradually climbing the development ladder; there are effectively two separate countries sharing a flag.

## The poster children

Consider the canonical examples of middle income stagnation: Thailand, Malaysia, and Brazil. All three went through so-called economic miracles, periods of rapid growth that dazzled Wall Street and inspired breathless projections. Analysts drew straight lines decades into the future, predicting convergence with the developed world within a generation.

What these projections missed was the structure of the growth itself. The "miracles" were built on exploitation of vast rural workforces, whether for resource extraction, plantation agriculture, or low-wage manufacturing. Peasants flooded into factories and mines, producing enormous GDP gains as their labor shifted from subsistence farming to the formal economy. This is the easy part of development--the [Lewis turning point](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lewis_model), where surplus rural labor gets absorbed into modern industry.

But this kind of growth is self-limiting. Once the pool of cheap rural labor is exhausted--or, more accurately, once the easy-to-exploit portion is absorbed--growth rates inevitably slow. The remaining rural population is too remote, too uneducated, or too politically marginalized to be profitably integrated. And so the "miracle" ends, not because the country hit some technological ceiling, but because it ran out of people willing to work for next to nothing.

China exemplifies this dynamic on a scale never before seen. For three decades, hundreds of millions of peasants poured from the countryside into coastal factories, producing the most spectacular growth in human history. But as the population ages and the low-hanging fruit of rural-to-urban migration is picked clean, the economy is slowing--and the hundreds of millions left behind in the interior remain crushingly poor. Shenzhen may rival Silicon Valley, but Gansu remains closer to sub-Saharan Africa.

The government's determination to maintain high GDP growth, even as the underlying model exhausts itself, has produced one bubble after another: the [stock market crash of 2015](https://www.vox.com/2015/7/8/8911519/china-stock-market-charts), the [peer-to-peer lending debacle](https://www.reuters.com/article/business/leader-of-chinas-9-billion-ezubao-online-scam-gets-life-26-jailed-idUSKCN1BN0J9/) of the late 2010s, and the real estate implosion unfolding today. Each represents an attempt to conjure growth through financial engineering rather than the harder work of redistributing wealth and rebalancing the economy toward domestic consumption. Whether China can pivot to a sustainable model, or will instead join Thailand and Brazil in prolonged stagnation, remains the great economic question of our time.

Yet decades later, all three remain stuck. Thailand's GDP per capita, adjusted for purchasing power, is roughly where South Korea's was in 1990. Malaysia has made progress but still lags far behind its neighbor Singapore. Brazil's income per capita has barely budged since the turn of the millennium.

The standard narrative blames the 1997 Asian financial crisis, commodity dependence, or failure to move up the value chain. But Bangkok, Kuala Lumpur, and São Paulo tell a different story. These cities boast world-class infrastructure, sophisticated financial sectors, and thriving tech scenes. Their elites live lives indistinguishable from those of their counterparts in Tokyo or New York. The "trap" hasn't prevented these countries from achieving development--it's prevented them from spreading it.

Meanwhile, the Thai countryside remains dominated by subsistence rice farming. Malaysia's rural Malay population lags far behind urban Chinese Malaysians. Brazil's northeast, home to a quarter of the population, has income levels comparable to Central America. These aren't countries that failed to develop; they're countries where development stopped at the city limits.

## The original sin

Countries reliant on the primary sector for wealth are especially vulnerable to this pattern. The canonical example is Argentina, which in the early 20th century ranked among the five wealthiest nations in the world. Beef exports to Europe made Buenos Aires one of the globe's most glamorous capitals, with architecture and cultural institutions rivaling Paris. Economists of the era confidently predicted Argentina would soon surpass most of Europe.

A century later, Argentina is synonymous with economic dysfunction--a cautionary tale of inflation, default, and squandered potential. Venezuela tells a similar story: in the 1970s, it was the richest country in Latin America, wealthy enough that Concorde operated a supersonic route out of Caracas. Today it is a humanitarian catastrophe. What happened in both cases? The same pattern that would later afflict Thailand and Brazil. Wealth from commodity exports concentrated in the hands of elites--Argentina's landed *estancieros*, Venezuela's oil oligarchs--who had no incentive to industrialize or educate the poor. When prices fluctuated and competitors emerged, there was no diversified economy to fall back on, and no broad middle class to sustain domestic demand.

The fundamental problem with primary sector wealth is that it's easy to replace. Cattle can be raised elsewhere; oil can be extracted from other fields. A country that builds its prosperity on commodities is always one market shift away from irrelevance. Manufacturing and services, by contrast, build human capital and institutional capacity that competitors cannot simply replicate overnight. But transitioning from extraction to production requires investment in people--exactly what commodity oligarchs are least inclined to support.

Manufacturing alone does not guarantee prosperity, however. The Soviet Union had an enormous industrial sector, producing not just military hardware but civilian goods like airliners and automobiles. Yet its planned economy could never balance supply and demand, leading to chronic shortages, misallocation, and eventual collapse. Building factories is not the same as building wealth; what matters is whether production responds to actual human needs and whether the gains flow broadly through society. The Soviets checked neither box.

Argentina's tragedy wasn't inevitable. Australia and Canada also built early wealth on primary exports--wool, wheat, minerals--yet successfully transitioned to diversified, high-income economies. The difference was political: Australia and Canada distributed land more broadly, invested in universal education, and built institutions that allowed for economic adaptation. Argentina's oligarchs, like Brazil's *fazendeiros* and Thailand's Bangkok elite, preferred to keep the gains for themselves. The result was a century of stagnation punctuated by periodic crises, each one blamed on some external factor rather than the fundamental distribution problem at its core.

## The modo hoc fallacy

Comparing countries by GDP growth rates commits what might be called the *modo hoc* fallacy--judging something by its raw material while ignoring the arrangement. Two countries both posting 8% annual growth could be doing so for entirely different reasons, one sustainable and the other not. South Korea in the 1970s and Thailand in the 1990s both exhibited rapid growth, but the underlying structures were worlds apart. Korea was building broad-based industrial capacity with heavy investment in education; Thailand was riding a wave of cheap labor and foreign capital that would crash spectacularly in 1997.

The cultural and political institutions of a country determine how capable it is of pivoting when the limits of its current development model are reached. As economist Michael Pettis [has argued](https://carnegieendowment.org/china-financial-markets/2014/06/the-four-stages-of-chinese-growth), drawing on Alexander Gerschenkron's work on economic backwardness, a development model that has delivered benefits to the ruling class for a long period becomes extraordinarily difficult to change. The very elites who benefited from the old model--export manufacturers, resource extractors, real estate developers--become vested interests blocking the transition to a new one.

This is why the "trap" appears so sticky. It's not that countries lack the knowledge or resources to develop differently; it's that the people in charge have no incentive to change course. The factory owners and mining magnates who grew rich on cheap rural labor aren't eager to support policies that would raise wages, improve rural education, or redistribute land. The growth model that made them wealthy is the growth model they'll defend, even as it runs out of steam.

## The productivity red herring

Standard middle income trap theory holds that countries get stuck because they can't make the transition from labor-intensive manufacturing to innovation-driven growth. They lack the educational infrastructure, R&D capacity, or institutional support for high-value industries.

But this explanation doesn't survive contact with reality. China produces cutting-edge semiconductors, electric vehicles, and AI systems. Brazil has world-leading aerospace and agricultural technology firms. India's software industry competes globally. These countries have clearly demonstrated the capacity for innovation and high-productivity output.

What they haven't demonstrated is the capacity--or willingness--to spread the fruits of that productivity beyond a small urban elite. The "trap" isn't that countries can't produce advanced goods; it's that they can't or won't distribute the resulting wealth.

## Political economy, not financial economy

The middle income trap is fundamentally a problem of political economy, not financial economy. It's not about lacking capital, technology, or know-how. It's about power--who has it, and who decides where resources flow.

In countries that have made the jump to high-income status, such as South Korea and Taiwan, land reform, universal education, and robust social safety nets ensured that growth lifted all boats[^1]. These policies were not inevitable outcomes of development; they were political choices made by governments that, for various reasons, chose broad-based prosperity over concentrated wealth.

We should be hesitant, however, about calling even these cases unqualified successes. South Korea's productivity remains below the OECD average, while its working hours are among the longest in the developed world. The country's suicide rate is one of the highest globally, and its fertility rate scrapes the bottom of international rankings. Escaping the middle income trap, it turns out, is not the same as building a society where people actually want to live and raise children. Korea distributed the gains of growth more broadly than Thailand or Brazil, but it did so by creating a pressure-cooker society that is now imploding demographically[^2].

Wealth also remains highly concentrated. The [chaebols](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chaebol)--family-run conglomerates like Samsung, Hyundai, and LG--account for roughly 10% of employment but contribute around two-thirds of GDP. Samsung alone represents nearly a quarter of the Korean economy. There are, in effect, two types of Korean workers: those with coveted positions at a chaebol, and everyone else working at the chicken shop[^3]. The land reform of the 1950s redistributed agricultural wealth, but the industrial wealth that replaced it has reconcentrated in a handful of dynastic families.

Countries stuck in the "trap" have made different choices. Their elites have captured the benefits of growth while insulating themselves from pressure to share. Weak institutions, corruption, and fragmented political systems make it difficult to implement the redistributive policies that would spread prosperity from urban cores to rural peripheries.

## The uncomfortable implication

Acknowledging that the middle income trap is really a distribution problem has uncomfortable implications. It means that countries aren't stuck due to forces beyond their control--they're stuck because of choices their leaders have made. It also means that the solution isn't more investment, technology transfer, or economic liberalization. The solution is political reform that enables more equitable resource distribution.

This is, of course, far harder than building another factory or training more engineers. Redistributive policies threaten entrenched interests. They require functional democratic institutions or at least a ruling coalition with incentives aligned toward broad-based growth. They demand the kind of state capacity that is itself a product of development.

The middle income trap, then, is less a trap and more a choice--or rather, the accumulated result of many choices made by those with power over those without. Breaking out requires not economic wizardry but political transformation, and that's something no amount of World Bank loans or IMF structural adjustments can provide.

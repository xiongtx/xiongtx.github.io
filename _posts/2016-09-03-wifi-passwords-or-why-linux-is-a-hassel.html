title: WiFi passwords--or, why Linux is a hassle
excerpt: Why must distros differ on unimportant things?
---

<p>
I recently had to reconnect to a wireless network that I have not connected to in a long time. Fortunately, though I had long forgotten the password, the computer still remembered it. Not wanting to find myself disconnected without knowing the password, I sought to look it up in the system.
</p>

<p>
A quick Google search indicated that <a href="http://askubuntu.com/a/139337">Ubuntu</a> stores wireless passwords at <code>/etc/NetworkManager/system-connections</code>. It quickly became clear that this was <i>not</i> where my Fedora system stores WiFi passwords: there are no files in the directory. This is surprising, since <code>NetworkManager</code> is a <a href="https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-US/Red_Hat_Enterprise_Linux/6/html/Deployment_Guide/ch-NetworkManager.html">RedHat product</a>.
</p>

<p>
Further investigation uncovered that Fedora stores WiFi passwords in the <code>/etc/sysconfig/network-scripts/</code> directory. I am <i>sure</i> that there are is a good reason for this, but that's beside the point. Implementing the same basic functionality&#x2013;storing WiFi passwords&#x2013;differently in two Linux distros is just unnecessary complexity.
</p>

<p>
The difference, however, is not large enough to avoid a <a href="http://news.softpedia.com/news/All-Linux-Distributions-Store-Wi-Fi-Passwords-in-Plain-Text-If-You-Don-t-Use-Encryption-412387.shtml">major security issue</a>: both distros store WiFi passwords in plain text files in under the <code>/etc</code> directory. Archlinux, which uses the <code>netctl</code> tool by default, is <i>somewhat</i> more secure through the use of encryption, but still far from perfect.
</p>

<p>
And therein lies the rub: Linux distros, for whatever reason, insist on <i>different</i>, not <i>better</i>, ways of doing things. Until these <i>unnecessary</i> differences are eliminated, the Linux community will find it difficult to make progress on important issues.

title: Holding the line
excerpt: What to do when you're not feeling motivated to get things done
---

<p>
Monday, August 1st was my last day at my current job. I've worked at Epic for just over three years, and it's time to move on to other opportunities.
</p>

<p>
I may write up a summary of my experiences at Epic some time in the future; in the mean time, interested readers may be pleased to learn that I maintain another blog<sup><a id="fnr.1" name="fnr.1" class="footref" href="#fn.1">1</a></sup>, <a href="http://healthtechreality.com/">Health Tech Reality</a>, about my experiences working in the healthcare IT industry in general and at Epic in particular.
</p>

<p>
In the week or so since quitting, I've found that my motivation and productivity have significantly declined. While working full time, I'd come home eager to <a href="https://www.coursera.org/specializations/scala">fire up Coursera</a>, or <a href="https://www.udemy.com/communicating-sequential-processes-with-coreasync/learn/v4/">go over lessons on Udemy</a>, or even just hack a bit of Emacs Lisp. Since quitting, however, I've struggled to get  <i>anything</i> done.
</p>

<p>
This is not the first time I've experienced this phenomenon; nor am I the only person to experience it. It's encapsulated in an old saying:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
If you want a task done, give it to a busy person
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
The removal of responsibility&#x2013;going to work, holding meetings, addressing deadlines&#x2013;can be disorienting, and may lead to a sudden loss of self-discipline. Instead of having <i>more</i> time, I feel that I have <i>less</i>. Being responsible for <i>all</i> of my time is a shock; I end up squandering it in ways I wouldn't if I had an external responsibility like a full-time job.
</p>

<p>
John has addressed this issue with a very practical piece of advice: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YYk91gtEzDE">hold the line</a>.
</p>

<p>
Everyone has days when they're feeling unmotivated. During these days, you <i>know</i> that you won't be making any progress towards your personal goals, whatever they may be.
</p>

<p>
The important thing is to avoid panicking and to understand that while you won't be making <i>progress</i>, you can avoid <i>regress</i>. Keep doing what you're doing, don't try to set new goals or plan new activities, but continue doing the things you're already committed to doing.
</p>

<p>
Unfortunately, I have not been able to hold the line perfectly. I've continued to update my blogs, but I haven't studied any Coursera or Udemy, and haven't worked on any side-projects at all. I know what the right thing to do is: <b>start working on whatever it is I'm supposed to work on</b>. Once something has been started, continuing it is easy. It's the getting started that's difficult.
</p>

<p>
Knowing what I'm supposed to do doesn't necessarily make it easier, but I'm determined to get back on track starting tomorrow.

<p>
An issue I've noticed is that, with technology in particular, <b>students are
taught the wrong way to do things before they are taught the right way</b>. Then
they are expected to do things "the right way" and never do it the wrong way
again.
</p>

<p>
That, unfortunately, is not how things work. <a href="http://lifehacker.com/you-play-like-you-practice-473540758">If you practice like you play,
you'll play like you practice</a>.
</p>

<p>
First, a little background. I have recently been taking some <a href="https://www.coursera.org/learn/responsive-website-examples/home/welcome">Coursera courses
on responsive web development</a>. The courses uses <a href="https://www.meteor.com/">Meteor</a> and <a href="https://docs.mongodb.org/manual/?_ga=1.167340220.386567681.1454295988">MongoDB</a>, with some
introductory work in basic HTML/CSS and <a href="http://getbootstrap.com/">Bootstrap</a>.
</p>

<p>
In both the Coursera lectures and the <a href="https://www.meteor.com/tutorials/blaze/creating-an-app">Meteor tutorials</a>, there is a tendency to
do things *"quick and dirty"*, to get the student to "jump into the pool". Make
JavaScript variables global, stick all your CSS in the same file, put your
Meteor client and server code in the same directory, etc.
</p>

<p>
By the end of the lesson, you've made something that "works", but you haven't
learned good practices, workflows, etc. that would allow you to create. It
wasn't until the <a href="https://www.coursera.org/learn/meteor-development/home/week/4">end of the third of five Coursera courses</a> that we talked
about how to organize and "clean up" the messy code we'd been working on. Oh,
and <b>forget about documentation</b>! No tutorial would bother covering that!
</p>

<p>
I certainly don't think that lessons should be bogged down in minutiae, but if
good practices are not learned early, bad habits will form that will be
<i>extremely</i> difficult to break later.
</p>

<p>
On the flip side, good habits are also hard to break. Ever met a developer who
drags his feet at writing documentation? Now imagine if he'd been forced to
write (good) documentation for all of his CS course projects. I'd bet that
he'd still be writing documentation at work out of sheer inertia.
</p>

<p>
Does it really matter that much? Documentation, by definition, does not change
program behavior, right? Well, not at any given instant in time, but it
strongly shapes the way that software evolves. This <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Av0PQDVTP4A">video on literate
programming</a> by Timothy Daly explains it well.
</p>

<p>
Even if that still does not convince you, consider another topic that is
rarely covered in early tutorials: <b>security</b>.
</p>

<p>
Why is so much software insecure?  It's not just that security is hard; it's
that people don't think about it&#x2013;are not taught to think about it&#x2013;until
they've already formed non-secure habits.
</p>

<p>
New Meteor apps include two insecure packages, <code>autopublish</code> and <code>insecure</code>,
by default. They're intended for "rapid prototyping", but I'll bet my last
dollar there are Meteor apps out there with sensitive information exposed
because the developer didn't know to, or simply forgot to, remove these
packages! My <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/q/35107026/864684">StackOverflow post</a> criticizing this behavior was not
well-received.
</p>

<p>
I'll end with a <a href="http://blogs.umb.edu/quoteunquote/2012/05/08/its-a-much-more-effective-quotation-to-attribute-it-to-aristotle-rather-than-to-will-durant/">quote</a>:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
We are what we repeatedly do. Excellence, then, is not an act, but a habit.
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
Given that we constantly learn and practice doing things the wrong way, is it
any wonder that we do it the wrong way when it really matters that we don't?

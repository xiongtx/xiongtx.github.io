As I've been learning some Haskell with the excellent <a href="http://learnyouahaskell.com/chapters">Learn You a Haskell for Great Good!</a>, I've come across <a href="https://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/category+theory#idea">category theory</a>, which is the theoretical mathematical foundation of Haskell, in much the same way that lambda calculus is the foundation of Lisp.
</p>

<p>
As with any field of expertise, you often hear exaggerated claims like "you can't <i>really</i> understand Haskell unless you understand category theory"; I've heard similar claims about Lisp and lambda calculus, so I knew not to take such claims very seriously. While learning the theoretical foundations will improve understanding, which is a good thing, it is certainly not <i>necessary</i> to use the language proficiently.
</p>

<p>
Imagine requiring every driver to understand thermodynamics, or simply the basics of automobile construction, before they get to turn the keys on a car&#x2013;we'd have very few drivers. These sorts of claims, which are usually made by amateurs rather than experts, serve as a <b>gatekeeping mechanism</b> to prevent the "everyman" from joining the language community.
</p>

<p>
As a math major, however, my curiosity was piqued. While I was learning Lisp, I had read Greg Michaelson's <a href="https://www.cs.rochester.edu/~brown/173/readings/LCBook.pdf">An Introduction to Functional Programming Through Lambda Calculus</a>, which is a fine introduction to the topic.
</p>

<p>
I looked for a similar introduction to category theory, and came across <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BF6kHD1DAeU">Steve Adowey's lectures</a>. The lectures are from the University of Oregon's <a href="https://www.cs.uoregon.edu/research/summerschool/summer12/curriculum.html">2012 summer school on Logic, Languages, Compilation, and Verification</a>. Lecture notes, exercises, and Prof. Adowey's textbook <a href="http://www.andrew.cmu.edu/user/awodey/SummerSchool/">available on his website</a>.
</p>

<p>
Category theory is, as Prof. Adowey puts it, the <b>abstract algebra of functions</b>. It is definitely a harder topic to approach than lambda calculus. To begin, you'll need a good grasp of abstract algebra and be <i>very</i> comfortable with mathematical abstraction. In fact, the greatest benefit I've derived from learning category theory has been to exercise my "abstraction muscles".
</p>

<p>
Learning category theory while studying Haskell is doubly useful, because I get to <i>apply</i> the knowledge to something concrete&#x2013;which is not often the case in mathematics. Thanks to category theory, I have a better understanding of what types, functions, and functors are. Much to my frustration, however, monads are still a ways off&#x2013;they are not covered until the last chapter of the textbook.
</p>

<p>
Has learning category theory made me a better programmer? I don't think so, but that's not <i>why</i> I'm learning it. I'm learning it purely out of curiosity about the foundations of programming. That's the only <i>good</i> reason, I think, for a developer to spend time on the topic.

<p>A few days ago, I had migrated my blog from <tt>Wordpress.com</tt> to my personal domain. I used <tt>000webhost.com</tt> as my free host. Since my experience with them was not at all positive, I won't post a link here. </p>
<p><tt>000webhost.com</tt> promises a large amount of storage and various other features, including 99% uptime, to free users. After I signed up with them and went through the trouble of setting up my site, their server came under DDOS attack, rendering my site inaccessible. After reading some online reviews, I think there are two possibilities:</p>
<ol>
<li> They have a lot of enemies because of poor service/shady business practices.
</li>
<li> They are purposefully withholding service to get free users to upgrade to their (quite expensive) paid plan.
</li>
</ol>
<p>These two possibilities are not mutually exclusive. Suffice to say that free always comes at a price. </p>
<p>I've since moved on to <tt>Hostgator.com</tt>, which has some pretty good internet reviews. Service so far seems decent; the DNS propagation took minutes as opposed to two days, although I don't know if this is simply because I learned to flush my DNS buffers on Fedora 16. Hostgator usually offers a 25% discount on any purchase through a plethora of coupon codes floating around the internet. Around Black Friday/Cyber Monday the discounts can be as steep as 50-80%, but at this point I'm not willing to wait 7 months. </p>
<p>Hostgator also offers one-click Wordpress install, as well as a bunch of other features.  </p>
<p>The theme I am currently using, Clean Home, can be downloaded <a href="http://blog.tianxiangxiong.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/clean-home1.zip">here</a>. This minimalist theme is by Bryan Helmig of <a href="http://midmodesign.com/">Mid Mo Design</a>.</p>
<p>The <a href="http://wordpress.org/extend/themes/clean-home">official theme</a> on <tt>Wordpress.org</tt> is NOT the same as the one I am using. There are two versions: the official version and a Dreamhost version. I am using the Dreamhost version, which I believe to be superior in design. </p>

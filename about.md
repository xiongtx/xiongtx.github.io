Hi, I'm TX. Healthcare IT developer, Emacs lover, and clean code fanatic.

I write about technologies, especially what I discover on the road to mastering them, as well as things I'm doing to improve the learning process for myself and others.

You can check out some of my [open-source projects](http://www.tianxiangxiong.com/projects). Hopefully they'll be of some use to you!

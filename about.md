Hi, I'm TX. Developer, Emacs lover, and clean code fanatic.

Here on my personal blog, I write about technologies, especially what I discover on the road to mastering them, as well as things I'm doing to improve the learning process for myself and others.

I also maintain another blog, [Health Tech Reality](http://www.healthtechreality.com/), on my experiences working in the healthcare IT industry.

You can check out some of my [open-source projects](http://www.tianxiangxiong.com/projects). Hopefully they'll be of some use to you!

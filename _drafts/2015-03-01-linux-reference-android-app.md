title: "Linux Reference Android App"

I've been looking for a way to learn about Linux in a "flashcard" fashion for some time, but never really found a good way until I came across the [Linux Reference Pro](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id%3Dcom.poash.linuxreferencepro) application on the Google Play store. There is a free version available at [Linux Reference Free](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id%3Dcom.poash.linuxreferencelite), but the pro version is only $0.99 and gets rid of the annoying ads that plague free Android apps, so it's a worthwhile purchase.

Unlike many other apps on the Play Store, this app does more than display a few "cheatsheet" images. It actually bothers to put its content into proper Android Widgets like `ListViews`. Considering the multitude of similar apps that try to take the easy way out, this deserves applause.

The app covers over 40 Linux-related topics succinctly: from the history of Linux, to managing users, to processes and job control. Each topic is covered in a section containing some simple explanations, a few illustrations, and useful commands. The app does not go into excruciating detail; for that, a technical reference would be more appropriate.

The small list of useful commands and their flags is particularly valuable, since many commands (e.g. `su`) have a multitude of flags, some of which are much more commonly used than others. Trying to learn all the flags for a command in an exhaustive fashion is not, in my opinion, a good use of time. The [Pareto Principle](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pareto_principle) applies in full force here: 80% of the functionality is contained in 20% of the flags, so it's important to know which ones to focus on and remember.

The app isn't perfect; the English is a little rough sometimes, and there are some strange statements such as this gem from the "History" section:

> The different variants of UNIX are called as UNIX-like operating systems, such as Linux, Solaris, Fedora, etc.

I guess Fedora qualifies as a variant of UNIX, but I think it would be more proper to say that it's a variant of Linux. After all, Linux is explicitly named as a variant of UNIX, along with Solaris.

All in all, I'm quite happy with the app. I plan on browsing a section or two when I have free time with my phone, and let the information sink in over time in a casual way.

After using WordPress to host my blog and [homepage](http://www.tianxiangxiong.com) for several years, I've come to the conclusion that WordPress is not the appropriate platform for me.

-   It's not plain text.
	-   Most of my blog posts are simple, with very little in the way of rich media. A MySQL database is overkill.
-   It's not local.
	-   I don't like my content existing solely in "the cloud". Having it available locally means I can update and deploy it whenever I want. If I lose it, it's solely my fault.
-   The small burden of having to log-in to WordPress to write up a post discourages me from posting, especially since I rarely finish a post in one sitting.

	(setq something (1 2 3))

Therefore, I've decided to migrate my blog over to [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/) using [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/).

I've developed a few open source projects, mostly dealing with improving workflows for documentation lookup.

- [helm-cider](https://github.com/clojure-emacs/helm-cider), an Emacs package to look up symbols, namespaces, descriptions, etc. for Clojure.
- [helm-describe-modes](https://github.com/emacs-helm/helm-describe-modes), an Emacs package to look up mode information. Goodbye, 20,000-character buffer from `describe-mode`!
- [jdecomp](https://github.com/xiongtx/jdecomp), an Emacs interface to Java decompilers.

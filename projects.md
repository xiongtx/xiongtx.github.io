I've developed a few open source projects, mostly dealing with improving workflows for documentation lookup.

- [helm-cider](https://github.com/clojure-emacs/helm-cider), an Emacs package to look up symbols, namespaces, descriptions, etc. for Clojure.
- [helm-describe-modes](https://github.com/emacs-helm/helm-describe-modes), an Emacs package to look up mode information. Goodbye, 20,000-character buffer from `describe-mode`!
- [helm-info](https://github.com/emacs-helm/helm/blob/master/helm-info.el), a tool for quickly browsing [GNU Info](https://www.gnu.org/software/texinfo/) files on your system.

Here's a quick tip: you can change the default text editor in GNOME (and
likely any [[https://www.freedesktop.org/wiki/][Free Desktop]]) by creating a =defaults.list= file in
=~/.local/share/applications/=.

I'm using Emacsclient through a bash script taken from [[http://mjwall.com/blog/2013/10/04/how-i-use-emacs/][MJ Wall]]. After creating
an =ec.desktop= file, where =/my-user-name/= is obviously my user name:

#+BEGIN_SRC
[Desktop Entry]
Categories=Utility;TextEditor
Comment=Edit files with the ec command
Exec=/home/my-user-name/.emacs.d/ec %f
Icon=/home/my-user-name/img/emacs.png
MimeType=text/plain
Name=ec
Type=Application
#+END_SRC

I created a =defaults.list= file containing:

#+BEGIN_SRC
[Default Applications]
text/plain=ec.desktop
#+END_SRC

And voila! Sure beats having to specify the default editor for /every/ file type!

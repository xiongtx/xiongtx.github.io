As I've gotten older, I've begun to increasingly notice the negative impact that poor sleep has on my physical and mental conditions.

Physically, poor sleep leads to tiredness and slow reaction times throughout the day. Mentally, it decreases the amount of information that can be held in the head at the same time and increases the latency of recall, both disastrous for software development.

No matter what needs to be done, a good night's sleep is paramount. If you're having a poor-performing day, the first question to ask is: might it be because I didn't get enough sleep? All too often, the answer is yes.

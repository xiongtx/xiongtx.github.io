In my latest attempt to understand what a monad is and why it's useful, I've come much further than previous attempts by doing one thing--putting aside the math.

That's right--for the first time, I resisted the urge to start reading about category theory halfway through reading about monads.

Instead, I forced myself to stare at the function signatures of Haskell's ~Functor~, ~Applicative~ and ~Monad~ and think in terms of "wrapping" and "unwrapping" boxes. In other words, I actually tried to be a /programmer/ for once[fn:1].

Given the progress I've made this time around, I think I'll do this more in the future.

Be a programmer. Be dumb. The math can wait.

[fn:1] And now I feel terribly dirty and in need of a hot shower.

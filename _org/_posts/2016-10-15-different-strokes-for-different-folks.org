A few months ago, I began working for [[https://www.fundingcircle.com/us/][Funding Circle]], an online marketplace for small business loans. It's been an interesting experience, but a big culture shock in terms of the company's approach to technology.

** Two approaches to technology

My previous employer, [[http://www.epic.com/][Epic]], had some ideas about technology that I found hard to swallow. These include:

- Be wary of tech trends
- Use as much [[https://www.techopedia.com/definition/3848/not-invented-here-syndrome-nihs][in-house technology]] as possible
- Only get third-party technology when necessary, and only from [[https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/][large, trusted vendors]]
- Avoid open-source technology

Funding Circle takes a different approach:

- Embrace cutting-edge ideas
- Use open-source technologies
- Get third-party technology from [[http://www.confluent.io/][smaller]] [[https://www.hashicorp.com/][companies]] (unless it's [[https://aws.amazon.com/][infrastructure]]...)

As with most things, there are advantages and disadvantages to both approaches.

** Epic

Epic sells software and consulting services to medium and large healthcare organizations. This is a [[http://healthtechreality.com/we-buy-for-life/][long-term relationship]]--the time that it takes for an organization to "[[http://healthtechreality.com/roles-at-epic-implementers/][go live]]" can be longer than the entire existence of a Bay Area start-up. The relationship will be particularly long-lived given Epic's utter dominance in this sector.

Epic itself has been around since 1979--the same year that [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/VisiCalc][VisiCalc]] was released. The company and its technology have outlived many tech trends, and will no doubt outlive many more. Long after everyone has forgotten what a Docker container is, Epic's Cach√©-based backend will still be serving the world's largest hospitals.

** Funding Circle

Funding Circle is competing in a relatively new space: a marketplace for small businesses to get loans online and investors to purchase those loans. The dust has not yet settled in this sector, so "move fast and break things" is a more feasible--perhaps necessary--approach.

The US operation, which was purchased by UK-based Funding Circle a few years ago, has already gone through two tech stacks--first Excel[fn:1], then Ruby on Rails. Now we are moving to Clojure[fn:2], Kafka, micro-services, etc.--exciting, but perhaps also ephemeral. How long before another tech stack switch? I doubt anyone knows.

** Which approach do you prefer?

The approach to technology at a company are dictated by many factors, including the company's longevity, size, and culture.

The approach that a company takes no doubt works for that company, but as a developer, it's worth asking: which approach do you prefer? Would you want to work at an Epic-like company or a Funding Circle-like company?

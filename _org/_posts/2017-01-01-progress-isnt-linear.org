The best advice I've ever heard regarding success is simply

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
Finish what you start
#+END_QUOTE

The simplicity is deceiving; sticking with something to the /end/, however that's defined, is very hard to do. Most people quit shortly after they start, when the initial burst of progress that accompanies a new endeavor fades and is replaced by a long, slow slog.

The biggest challenge is that *progress isn't linear*. This is a well-understood phenomenon, often referred to as the *valley of despair*.

One year ago, I began to seriously look at [[https://clojure.org/][Clojure]], and started having the aspiration of using it in my day job. At the time, I was writing [[http://www.intersystems.com/our-products/cache/cache-overview/][Cach√©]] as a business intelligence developer at Epic and feeling very unhappy at my job, especially at the use of old, niche technology that wasn't teaching me anything new. For months, I wasn't sure I would be able to make the switch to software development, let alone in Clojure. I knew very little about popular technologies, from cloud computing to machine learning, and knew only the basics of web development.

It is my great fortune that, when under stress, I have a tendency to rise to the challenge. I took [[https://www.coursera.org/learn/meteor-development][Cousera courses on web development]]; I [[https://www.amazon.com/Cracking-Coding-Interview-Programming-Questions/dp/098478280X][practiced interview questions]] with friends; I attended [[http://clojurewest.org/][Clojure/west]] and met the great Clojure community. Six months later I interviewed with and received an offer from [[https://www.fundingcircle.com/us/][Funding Circle]].

Looking back, I probably fell victim to a familiar mindset of *overestimating challenges*. When challenges appear overwhelming, it can be difficult to get started. Yet, once the initial foot-dragging is overcome, working harder than I "need" to is often an advantage: I end up learning a lot more than I would otherwise.

So how can I best make use of a fresh set of 365 days? A few words of advice to myself:

- Get started /now/, no matter how big the challenge
- Take both accomplishments and setbacks in context
- Expect long stretches of (seemingly) no progress, i.e. the valley of despair. Keep moving during such times.
- You don't have complete control over outcomes, but you do have control over your time. Don't waste time.
- Plan
  - If you value your time, planning becomes an itch to scratch
  - Planning shorter periods (a week, a month) is easier than planning longer periods
- Finish what you start

None of these are "resolutions", per se. Resolutions are about outcomes, and people usually fail to achieve them because they haven't changed their /mindset/ and /processes/ from the past year; as such, they follow the same processes and expect a different outcome.

Changing mindset and processes is much harder than desiring an outcome. It is /especially/ vulnerable to long stretches of (seemingly) no progress: the time frame is a lifetime. So, what's a better time to get started than /now/?
